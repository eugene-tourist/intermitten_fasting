        <h1 class="title">Intermittent Fasting: What is it, and how does it work?</h1>
        <p class="title-text"><span class="i">I</span>ntermittent fasting is an eating plan that switches between fasting and eating on a regular schedule. Research shows
        that intermittent fasting is a way to manage your weight and prevent — or even reverse — some forms of disease. But how
        do you do it? And is it safe?</p>
        <h2 class="sub-title">What is intermittent fasting?</h2>
        <p class="text-1">Many diets focus on what to eat, but intermittent fasting is all about when you eat.</p>
        <p class="text-2">Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Mark Mattson has studied intermittent fasting for 25 years. He says that our bodies have
        evolved to be able to go without food for many hours, or even several days or longer. In prehistoric times, before
        humans learned to farm, they were hunters and gatherers who evolved to survive — and thrive — for long periods without
        eating. They had to: It took a lot of time and energy to hunt game and gather nuts and berries.</p>
        <p class="text-3">Even 50 years ago, it was easier to maintain a healthy weight. Johns Hopkins dietitian Christie Williams, M.S., R.D.N.,
        explains: “There were no computers, and TV shows turned off at 11 p.m.; people stopped eating because they went to bed.
        Portions were much smaller. More people worked and played outside and, in general, got more exercise.”</p>
        <p class="text-4">Nowadays, TV, the internet and other entertainment are available 24/7. We stay awake for longer hours to catch our
        favorite shows, play games and chat online. We’re sitting and snacking all day — and most of the night.”</p>
        <p class="text-5">Extra calories and less activity can mean a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses.
        Scientific studies are showing that intermittent fasting may help reverse these trends.</p>
